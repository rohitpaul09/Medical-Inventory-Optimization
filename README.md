# Medical-Inventory-Optimization

The overall project summary, integrating the objective, code summary, insights, and recommendations, is as follows:

**Objective**: The project aims to address the increasing bounce rate in a healthcare organization, leading to patient dissatisfaction. The primary goal is to minimize the bounce rate by at least 30% while reducing inventory costs, with an expected revenue increase of at least 20 lacs INR. Utilizing a Data Analytics Project Management Methodology, the project will handle a dataset of 14,218 rows and 14 columns, focusing on the Supply Chain Management department. The project is budgeted at $450, scheduled between 03/07/2023 and 24/07/2023, and assumes client-provided data and resources.

**Code Summary**: The project involves two main phases: data pre-processing and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The pre-processing phase, detailed in "Pre-processing Code SQL," includes data cleaning and normalization. The EDA phase, described in "EDA Code SQL," uses statistical analysis to understand data distribution and characteristics, focusing on the bounce rate and customer satisfaction issues in certain drug subcategories and formulations.

**Insights**:
1. Cleaning the data led to more stable distributions, essential for accurate decision-making.
2. The analysis identified a 24.9% bounce rate, indicating substantial customer dissatisfaction.
3. Specific subcategories like "INJECTIONS" and "TABLETS & CAPSULES" and the "Form1" formulation were identified as having high return counts.
4. Seasonal trends in hospital operations, with varying revenue and demand across different months, were noted.

**Recommendations**:
1. Intensive analysis of the "INJECTIONS" and "TABLETS & CAPSULES" subcategories to identify and address causes of high return rates.
2. Thorough evaluation of the "Form1" formulation for potential improvements or alternatives.
3. Assessment and potentially reevaluation of suppliers, particularly for products related to Department1 and "Form1" formulation.
4. Enhanced inventory management in Department1 to optimize stock levels and reduce returns.
5. Development of efficient return management practices in Department1.
6. Implementation of specialisation-specific strategies, particularly in Specialisation4 and Specialisation7, to address higher return rates.
7. Strategic seasonal resource allocation to optimize operations and resource use during peak and off-peak seasons.

By implementing these recommendations and focusing on identified areas of concern, the project aims to significantly reduce the bounce rate, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance the hospital's overall performance and revenue.
